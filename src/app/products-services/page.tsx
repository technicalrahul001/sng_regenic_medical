          Our Hybrid Fabrication Technology combines 3D-bioprinting and 3D-electrospinning to offer precision and versatility in tissue engineering. The 3D-bioprinting system features high-precision motors and customizable nozzles (14G to 22G) to create intricate tissue structures with a resolution of 0.02 Î¼m half-pitch. Using biocompatible and biodegradable bio-inks, researchers can design tissue models that support cell growth and differentiation. The 3D-electrospinning system utilizes proprietary nanogrid technology to produce nanofiber scaffolds with controlled fiber alignment, porosity, and geometry. By converting CAD designs into G-code, users can print highly customized scaffolds with micron-level precision, using a variety of biomaterials. Together, these technologies enable the fabrication of multi-layered tissue constructs, enhancing regenerative therapies, drug testing, and personalized regenerative devices.

        <p className="text-gray-200 text-xs md:text-sm text-center">
          We offer a range of advanced biomaterials specifically designed to support neural tissue engineering. Our portfolio includes two key types of biomaterials: electrospinning materials and bio-inks. The electrospinning materials are formulated to produce nanofiber-based 3D scaffolds that mimic the natural extracellular matrix, offering an ideal environment for neural cell adhesion, growth, and differentiation. Alongside these, we provide a proprietary bio-ink for 3D printing that is both biocompatible and conductive, specifically formulated to promote the growth and maintenance of neural cells. This bio-ink can be mixed with various cell types, such as neural stem cells or neurons, enabling the fabrication of complex tissue constructs with a controlled cellular density and architecture. The bio-ink degrades naturally over time, leaving behind a mature tissue that integrates seamlessly into the body.
